Foundation
---------------------

Overview
++++++++

.. note::

  Estimated time to complete: **60 Minutes**


Foundation is used to automate the installation of the hypervisor and Controller VM on one or more nodes. 
In this exercise you will practice imaging a physical cluster with Foundation. In order to keep the lab self-contained, you will create a single node "cluster" on which you will deploy your Foundation VM. That Foundation instance will be used to image and create a cluster from the remaining 3 nodes in the Block.


* In following steps, you may replace xx with your assigned cluster ID



DIY Your Environment
++++++++++++++++++++++++


A Hosted POC reservation provides a fully imaged cluster consisting of 4 nodes. To keep the lab self-contained within a single, physical block, you will:

- Destroy the existing cluster
- Create a single node "cluster" using Node D
- Install the Foundation VM on Node D
- Use Foundation to image Nodes A, B, and C and create a 3 node cluster


Using an SSH client, connect to the **Node A CVM IP** <10.42.xx.29> in your assigned block using the following credentials:

- **Username** - nutanix
- **Password** - *techX2019!*

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh nutanix@10.42.xx.29          # password: techX2019!

Execute the following commands to power off any running VMs on the cluster, stop cluster services, and destroy the existing cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

  cluster stop        # Enter 'Y' when prompted to proceed
  cluster destroy     # Enter 'Y' when prompted to proceed


Create Node D Cluster 
+++++++++++++++++++++

Remaining in SSH client, access Node-D CVM and execute following commands

.. code-block:: bash

 ssh nutanix@10.42.xx.32           # password: techX2019!
 cluster -s 10.42.xx.32 create       # Enter 'Y' when prompted to proceed

 ncli cluster edit-params new-name=POCxx-D
 ncli cluster add-to-name-servers servers=10.42.196.10
 ncli user reset-password user-name='admin' password=techX2019! 

.. note::

  The above command will create a "cluster" from a single node using RF1, offering no redundancy to recover from hardware failure. This configuration is being used for non-production, instructional purposes and should **NEVER** be used for a customer deployment.

  After the "cluster" is created, Prism will reflect Critical Health status due to lack of redundancy.

Install Foundation VM 
++++++++++++++++++++++

Open \https://*<Node D CVM IP>*:9440 (\https://10.42.xx.32:9440) in your browser and log in with the following credentials:

.. note::

  The Foundation VM IP address should be in the same subnet as the target IP range for the CVM/hypervisor of the nodes being imaged. As Foundation is typically performed on a flat switch and not on a production network, the Foundation IP can generally be any IP in the target subnet that doesn't conflict with the CVM/hypervisor/IPMI IP of a targeted node.

Select **Save** and press **Return**.

Foundation Node ABC cluster
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, Foundation does not have any AOS or hypervisor images. You can download your desired AOS package from the `Nutanix Portal <https://portal.nutanix.com/#/page/releases/nosDetails>`_.

If downloading the AOS package within the Foundation VM, the .tar.gz package can also be moved to ~/foundation/nos rather than uploaded to Foundation through the web UI. 
  
To shorten the lab time, we use command line to access foundation VM and download NOS binary to designated folder in it.
  
Open a terminal and ssh to foundation VM through foundation IP <10.42.xx.45>
  
.. code-block:: bash

 ssh nutanix@10.42.xx.45      # provide default password 
 cd foundation
 cd nos
 wget  https://ntnx-portal.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/euphrates-5.10.5-stable/nutanix_installer_package-release-euphrates-5.10.5-stable.tar.gz
 ..


When you see 100% finish, AOS 5.10.5 package has been downloaded to ~/foundation/nos folder.

From within the Foundation VM console, launch **Nutanix Foundation** from the desktop.

Access foundation UI via any browser at \http://*<Foundation VM IP 10.42.xx.45>*:8000/gui/index.html

On the **Start** page, click **Next**.

- **network** – eth0
- **Select your hardware platform**: Autodetect
- **Netmask of Every Hypervisor and CVM** - 255.255.255.128
- **Gateway of Every IPMI** - 10.42.xx.1
- **Netmask of Every IPMI** - 255.255.255.128
- **Gateway of Every Hypervisor and CVM** - 10.42.xx.1


.. image:: images/image014.png

In new foundation page, clear all auto discovered nodes and click **add nodes manually**


.. image:: images/image0141.png


Fill in block information, choose **I will provide the IPMIs' MACs** and click **Add**


.. image:: images/image104.png

.. note::

 Foundation will automatically discover any hosts in the same IPv6 Link Local broadcast domain that is not already part of a cluster. 

 When transferring POC assets in the field, it's not uncommon to receive a cluster that wasn't properly destroyed at the conclusion of the previous POC. In that case, the nodes are already part of existing clusters and will not be discovered. 
  
 In this lab, we choose manually specify the MAC address instead in order to practice as the real world.

.. note::
 
 There are at least 2 methods to know MAC address remotely.

 Method.1 Identify MAC Address (BMC MAC address) of Nodes (A, B, C) by accessing IPMI IP for each node
  
 Method.2 Identify MAC Address of Nodes (A, B, C) by login AHV host with User: root, Password: *default* for each node
  

Access Node A IPMI through IP 10.42.xx.33 with ADMIN/ADMIN


.. image:: images/image101.png


.. image:: images/image102.png


Record your NODE A/B/C BMC MAC address ( in above example , it is **ac:1f:6b:1e:95:eb** )


Doing the same with your other 2 nodes B/C, access Node B and C IPMI through IP 10.42.xx.34/35 with ADMIN/ADMIN, record all 3 BMC MAC addresses.



Selecting NODE, click **Range Autofill** in drop-down list of **Tools**, replacing the octet(s) that correspond to your HPOC network, fill out the following fields and select **Next**:

- **IPMI MAC** - the three your just recorded down
- **IPMI IP** - 10.42.xx.33
- **Hypervisor IP** - 10.42.xx.25
- **CVM IP** - 10.42.xx.29
- **Node A Hypervisor Hostname** – POCxx-1


.. image:: images/image105.png


Replacing the octet(s) that correspond to your HPOC network, fill out the following fields and select **Next**:

Leave the first 2 options unselected, fill out the following fields and click **Next**:

- **Cluster Name** - POCxx-ABC
- **Timezone of Every Hypervisor and CVM** - *your local timezone*
- **Cluster Redundancy Factor** - 2
- **Cluster Virtual IP** - 10.42.xx.37

  *Cluster Virtual IP needs to be within the same subnet as the CVM/hypervisor.*

- **NTP Servers of Every Hypervisor and CVM** - 0.pool.ntp.org,0.au.pool.ntp.org,2.au.pool.ntp.org,0.sg.pool.ntp.org,1.sg.pool.ntp.org
- **DNS Servers of Every Hypervisor and CVM** - 10.42.196.10

  *DNS and NTP servers should be captured as part of install planning with the customer.*

- **vRAM Allocation for Every CVM, in Gigabytes** - 32

  *Refer to AOS Release Notes > Controller VM Memory Configurations for guidance on CVM Memory Allocation.*
   

To upload AOS or hypervisor files, click **Manage AOS Files**.


.. image:: images/image018.png
  
  
   Click **+ Add > Choose File**. Select your downloaded *nutanix_installer_package-release-\*.tar.gz* file and click **Upload**.

After the upload completes, click **Close**. Click **Next**.

Select **unless you want it** if it suggest you skip the AOS installaion process

Since we have already upload our desired AOS through command line, just select it and click **Next**


.. image:: images/image106.png
     

Fill out the following fields and click **Next**:

- **Select a hypervisor installer** - AHV, AHV installer bundled inside the AOS installer


.. image:: images/image020.png
